  title: 'The Origin Story '
  content: "The Purposeful Camp Namibia story starts with a ten minutes voice note
    that was send out at 3 AM that led to the fruition of the camp.\n\nSo, Ndakondja
    Uusiku was up at 3 AM watching motivational videos when the idea hit him like
    a lightening bolt, he opened up a WhatsApp group which consisted of Jane Hango,
    Tuilika Andreas and Paulina Hambata, send through a 10 minutes voice note that
    contained the details of the camp. During the morning hours of that day the girls
    agreed to the idea.\n\nOn the 12th June 2019 the team met at Cramers and that
    led to the creation of the founding team of Purposeful Camp Namibia which resulted
    to the ultimate purposeful experience as from 29 November – 4 December 2019 which
    resulted in the transformation of 40 participants.\n\nHere’s Our WHY \n\nWe are
    20 years into the 21st century and the status quo does not speak volume about
    millennials. Speaking from a personal insight, we attend so many personal development
    functions, and it is unfortunate that our peers are hardly seen at such functions
    but rather at less productive events. We have identified a gap in mind-sets and
    stereotypical mentalities within our generation. As the youth, it is not a questionable
    matter that we are the leaders and pioneers of tomorrow; however, the current
    conditions scream uncertainty as to whether we will be competent enough to spearhead
    this country into prosperity as our elders have done for us. There is no assurance
    that we will be able to take up the Namibian Torch and continue to run the race
    to make NAMIBIA GREAT. \nIt is against this background that we have taken the
    responsibility to uplift one another and bring about a revolution amongst the
    youth. We have decided to take on the challenge to empower our fellow youth on
    a national level, with Purposeful Camp Namibia. Purposeful Camp Namibia is a youth-led
    vibrant, uplifting and self-developing initiative for young Namibians. It targets
    to spearhead total youth emancipation within the 15-20 age group. \n\nAims and
    objectives \n-to instil a culture of engaging in purposeful occasions \n-to nurture
    potential public speakers and enhance their skills \n-to spark the spirit of financial,
    social and personal emancipation among youth \n-to assist in self-discovery and
    growth \n-to incorporate entrepreneurial mentorship \n-explore leadership aspects
    and apply them in daily life (both on a personal and communal scale) \n\nLong-term
    vision \nPurposeful Camp Namibia sees its annual alumni conquering and taking
    charge of their lives. We seek to send out confident and powerful influencers,
    trailblazers, positive disruptors and innovators into the mainstream youth development
    sphere of Namibia. The initiative envisions trainees and mentees \ntransforming
    the country through various activities that are aligned with the three P’s: Purpose,
    Passion and Proactivity. \nPlan of Action \nThe abovementioned aims will be met
    through a seven-day wilderness camp comprising of the following traits: \n▪ Course
    lectures on: personal development, financial education, leadership and public
    speaking skills \n▪ Practical activities on the aforementioned lectures \n▪ Engagement
    session with Purposeful Camp’s Patron (Hon. Tom Alweendo, Minister of Mines and
    Energy) \n▪ 3 months post-training mentorship series for camp alumni\n\n\n\n"
