  title: 'Here’s Our WHY '
  content: "We are 20 years into the 21st century and the status quo does not speak
    volume about millennials. Speaking from a personal insight, we attend so many
    personal development functions, and it is unfortunate that our peers are hardly
    seen at such functions but rather at less productive events. We have identified
    a gap in mind-sets and stereotypical mentalities within our generation. As the
    youth, it is not a questionable matter that we are the leaders and pioneers of
    tomorrow; however, the current conditions scream uncertainty as to whether we
    will be competent enough to spearhead this country into prosperity as our elders
    have done for us. There is no assurance that we will be able to take up the Namibian
    Torch and continue to run the race to make NAMIBIA GREAT. \nIt is against this
    background that we have taken the responsibility to uplift one another and bring
    about a revolution amongst the youth. We have decided to take on the challenge
    to empower our fellow youth on a national level, with Purposeful Camp Namibia.
    Purposeful Camp Namibia is a youth-led vibrant, uplifting and self-developing
    initiative for young Namibians. It targets to spearhead total youth emancipation
    within the 15-20 age group. \n\nAims and objectives \n-to instil a culture of
    engaging in purposeful occasions \n-to nurture potential public speakers and enhance
    their skills \n-to spark the spirit of financial, social and personal emancipation
    among youth \n-to assist in self-discovery and growth \n-to incorporate entrepreneurial
    mentorship \n-explore leadership aspects and apply them in daily life (both on
    a personal and communal scale) \n\nLong-term vision \nPurposeful Camp Namibia
    sees its annual alumni conquering and taking charge of their lives. We seek to
    send out confident and powerful influencers, trailblazers, positive disruptors
    and innovators into the mainstream youth development sphere of Namibia. The initiative
    envisions trainees and mentees \ntransforming the country through various activities
    that are aligned with the three P’s: Purpose, Passion and Proactivity. \nPlan
    of Action \nThe abovementioned aims will be met through a seven-day wilderness
    camp comprising of the following traits: \n▪ Course lectures on: personal development,
    financial education, leadership and public speaking skills\n▪ Practical activities
    on the aforementioned lectures \n▪ Engagement session with Purposeful Camp’s Patron
    (Hon. Tom Alweendo, Minister of Mines and Energy) \n▪ 3 months post-training mentorship
    series for camp alumni\n"
