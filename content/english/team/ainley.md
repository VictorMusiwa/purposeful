## Ainley Amunyela: Culinary Guru
Ainley Amunyela is currently a student at the University of Namibia's HGC campus studying towards a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Medicine and Surgery. She is the President of the Medical Students' Association of Namibia. Community development is something she is insanely passionate about and is hence a Committee Member of the Purpose Program, an occasional volunteer with the You are a Gift Foundation and serves as the Purposeful Camp Namibia's culinary guru. All things creativity and fashion are something she genuinely enjoys and has used platforms such as the Miss Teen Namibia organization and the Society of Performance Arts amongst others which have allowed her that outlet. In an attempt to strengthen skills and build networks, she is a part of the African Pathfinders Leadership Initiative cohort of 2020 fellows.
