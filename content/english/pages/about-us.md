**The Origin Story**
The Purposeful Camp Namibia story starts with a ten minutes voice note that was send out at 3 AM that led to the fruition of the camp.

So, Ndakondja Uusiku was up at 3 AM watching motivational videos when the idea hit him like a lightening bolt, he opened up a WhatsApp group which consisted of Jane Hango, Tuilika Andreas and Paulina Hambata, send through a 10 minutes voice note that contained the details of the camp. During the morning hours of that day the girls agreed to the idea.

On the 12th June 2019 the team met at Cramers and that led to the creation of the founding team of Purposeful Camp Namibia which resulted to the ultimate purposeful experience as from 29 November – 4 December 2019 which resulted in the transformation of 40 participants.

**Here’s Our WHY**
We are 20 years into the 21st century and the status quo does not speak volume about millennials. Speaking from a personal insight, we attend so many personal development functions, and it is unfortunate that our peers are hardly seen at such functions but rather at less productive events. We have identified a gap in mind-sets and stereotypical mentalities within our generation. As the youth, it is not a questionable matter that we are the leaders and pioneers of tomorrow; however, the current conditions scream uncertainty as to whether we will be competent enough to spearhead this country into prosperity as our elders have done for us. There is no assurance that we will be able to take up the Namibian Torch and continue to run the race to make NAMIBIA GREAT.

It is against this background that we have taken the responsibility to uplift one another and bring about a revolution amongst the youth. We have decided to take on the challenge to empower our fellow youth on a national level, with Purposeful Camp Namibia. Purposeful Camp Namibia is a youth-led vibrant, uplifting and self-developing initiative for young Namibians. It targets to spearhead total youth emancipation within the 15-20 age group.
